# Rusty Trade Engine

## About the project
The overall goal of this project is for an extremely fast, efficient and
stable trade/matching engine.  Rust was chosen in the hope that it would
reduce risk of exploits, increase stability and because I wanted to learn
rust.

The primary use cases for this project are:
* Platform for trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, USD, or other cryptocurrencies.
* An easy platform to be able to run and build simulations upon.

## Status
Currently the project is in the `proof` stage.  I would not recommend
to use this code in production unless you are prepared to put a lot
of work into it, however this project would be a great starting point
if your project overlaps.

## Install / Setup
1) Install rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2) Run `cargo run`
3) ???
4) PROFIT!!!
